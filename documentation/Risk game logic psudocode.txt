Game Setup{
	//for now we are expecting 4 players

		//If 4 are playing, each player counts out 30 Infantry.
		//If 5 are playing, each player counts out 25 Infantry.
		//If 6 are playing, each player counts out 20 Infantry.
	everybody gets 30 armies to place
		
	players all roll dice, highest roll goes first and so on
	game distributes random territories to all players one at a time
		//optional let players choose territories one at a time in turn order
	
	After all 42 territories are claimed, each player in turn places  
		one additional army onto any territory he or she already occupies.
		//if we want to speed this up we dont limit it by turn, everybody can at once
